    <h1>Recipes</h1>

    <a href="recipes/lasagna.html">Recipe Title</a>

    <p>
        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
        lines below me.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
        as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
        border width/height.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
        separated by the size of one of our margins, not both.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
        the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same
        line. Overflowing inline elements will
        <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>,
        or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
        <img src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/long.jpg" alt="snippet of cloth" />
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a paragraph. Some of the
        <span>words</span> have been wrapped in a <span>span element</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Item One</li>
        <li>Item Two</li>
        <li>Item Three</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="inline">I am a paragraph. A short one.</p>
    <p class="inline">I am another paragraph. Also a short one.</p>
