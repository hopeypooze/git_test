            <h3>Roasted Vegetables:</h3>
            Preheat oven to 200C/390F.<P>
                Place vegetables on the tray, drizzle with oil, sprinkle with garlic, salt and pepper. Toss.
            <P>
                Roast for 25 minutes, turning at 15 minutes, until tender and browned.
            <P>
                Remove from oven, loosen from tray with spatula while warm (can stick when cools).
            <P>
            <h3>Sauce:</h3>
            Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 3 minutes until golden.
            Add passata, crushed tomato, water, dried herbs, chilli, salt and pepper. Stir. Simmer on medium low heat
            for 20
            minutes. Adjust salt at the end. *Add a teeny touch of sugar if it’s a bit sour, depends on quality of
            tomatoes
            used.*<P>
                Remove from stove and let cool for 5 minutes before using.
            <h3>Ricotta Mixture:</h3>
            Place ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined.<P>
            <h3>Method:</h3>
            Preheat oven to 160C/320F.<P>
                Spread a ladle of tomato sauce on the base of a large baking dish (Note 5).
            <P>
                Cover with lasagna sheets, tearing as required to fit.
            <P>
                Top with roasted vegetables, scatter over red peppers. Spoon over 2 1/2 cups of Sauce, then sprinkle
                with
                half
                the
                cheese.
            <P>
                Cover with lasagna sheets. Spread over Ricotta mixture.
            <P>
                Cover with lasagna sheets. Pour over remaining sauce and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
            <P>
                Bake for 25 – 30 minutes or until the cheese is golden. If using dried lasagna sheets, stick a knife in
                the
                middle
                to ensure it’s cooked – if it needs longer, cover and stick it back in the oven.
            <P>
                Rest for 5 minutes before cutting and serving. Store leftovers per notes – brilliant reheated!
            <P>

            <h3>NOTES</h3>
            <div class="biglist">
                <OL>
                    <LI> Veggies – feel free to use any vegetables you want, just cut them so they roast in around 20 to
                        25
                        minutes.
                        Cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, squash are some I’ve used in the past.
                        Pumpkin: 600g/1.2lb unpeeled weight.
                    <LI> Ricotta – It’s best to get ricotta over the counter at the deli, even at supermarkets, rather
                        than
                        buying
                        in tubs unless it’s a brand you know is good like Paesanella. Harris Farms brand ricotta is also
                        good. I
                        find ricotta in tubs at supermarkets is typically grainy and kind of powdery – even the “big”
                        brands
                        (like
                        Perfect Italiano).
                    <LI> Tomato passata is pureed tomato, just plain tomato with no flavourings. It is so good for
                        making
                        sauces
                        like this because it’s smooth even without cooking it down for ages ie no tomato lumps. It comes
                        in
                        tall
                        bottles and is better value than canned tomato (by weight). Found in the pasta aisle of
                        supermarkets
                        in
                        Australia – it’s becoming increasingly popular. I like to use a combination of passata and
                        crushed
                        tomato
                        for for texture and flavour.
